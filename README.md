# TwitchGrid-vue-app
I made this app for learning purposes of vue and vuex- state management and project structure.
Also used axios =>Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
And Bootstrap-vue in project https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/

Used Twitch API endpoints @ https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference

*NOTE: I excluded 2x src/api files from project that perform http-get-requests to Twitch endpoints(api keys stored there).
